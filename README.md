# market-efficiency-analysis

This script reports the results of tests on the weak-form market efficiency applied to the following **12 market indexes**: CAC, DAX, DJ, EURSTOXX, FTSE, HSI, NASDAQ, NIKKEI, SMI, SP500, SSEC and PSI20. I used a **serial correlation test**, a **runs test**, an **Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller (ADF)** test and the **multiple variance ratio test** for the **hypothesis that the stock market index follows a random walk**. The tests are performed using **daily, weekly and monthly returns**. <u>The tables and graphs that resulted from the script are present in excels and graphs directory</u>.
