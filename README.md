# market-efficiency-analysis

This script reports the results of tests on the weak-form market efficiency applied to the following market indexes: CAC, DAX, DJ, EURSTOXX, FTSE, HSI, NASDAQ, NIKKEI, SMI, SP500, SSEC and PSI20. I used a serial correlation test, a runs test, an Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller (ADF) test and the multiple variance ratio test for the hypothesis that the stock market index follows a random walk. The tests are performed using daily, weekly and monthly returns. The tables and graphs that resulted from the script are present on excels and graphs directory.
